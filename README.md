# Setup
- Open IntelliJ.
- Go to the root of the project and type: `./build-and-run.sh` in a Terminal: 
  - sh only works in Bash.
  - This builds and adds the necessary things (Maven) and also starts a container for Spring Boot and for PostgreSQL respectively.
  - Make sure that the program is not running (IntelliJ).
- Go to the Database (IntelliJ plugin):
  - Create -> Data Source -> PostgreSQL
  - Fill in:
    - Host: localhost
    - User: postgres
    - Port: 5433
    - password: secret123
    - Database: patientdb
- Run the program (IntelliJ).
- Refresh the database.
